Tomorrow I'm at Wabash College working in Crawfordville.
property and then wednesday i'm underneath uh two-story building in carmel
doing plumbing for a
spa sauna so it'll be exciting i'll be in a lift about 30 feet in the air and plug it
over there
that's fun yeah just stressed about the taxes but i mean i have enough income
it's just it's just
cutting up different payments like this yeah making sure everything's broken
up and caught up
i get it man that's why i'm like you know i gotta get corrections because it's a
legal thing
i'm like but i'll have house taxes then i also have you know i just paid my
electric bill today
so it's just no stress and there's nothing wrong with that man there's nothing
wrong with being
stressed that's part of life right it's more of how you handle your stress you
know that's where
that's where the line comes at uh wednesday you have a meeting at what time
uh six so leave at
5 30. sure i'm assuming i don't know how where is it i thought main street 399
west main street
in greenwood it's the same psychologist i saw a couple weeks ago
you said 399 west main street yeah should be real type of didn't make sure
yeah you know what the name of the place was called
it is
Greenwood Counseling Associates.
It didn't pop up on my Apple Maps.
I had to Google that.
Right.
It starts at 6.
You know how long it usually lasts?
No.
It's not.
So it's like 7.
It'll be on by 7.30.
Yeah, that'll be 5.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
Anything?
Yeah, go ahead.
Saturday, can I get a haircut?
Yeah.
It'll be Sports Club on Smith Valley.
Are you working on Saturday or no?
Oh, I don't know anything about that.
I'll put it for after you get off or just be safe.
Yeah, that's fine. I appreciate that.
Sports clips.
I feel like uh Which one do you go to It on on smith valley it nothing sweet
deep 3147 west smith valley road sweet deep
I'm gonna say it again.
3147 West Smith Valley Road Sweetbeat.
That works.
So it takes about an hour to get a haircut.
So let's have you home at 7 p.m.

I like to open it until 8.
on Saturdays
or over until 6.
Okay, so do
4.30.
Get there at 5.00. Be done at 6.00.
Yeah, that's fine.
And then if you...
It's on your schedule, so if you don't work and you want to go earlier,
you can. It's on your schedule.
Does that make sense?
You can go early.
If you're not working and you want to go early, you can go early.
It's on your schedule.
Yeah, just because
you don't know if you're working or not.
So I want to make sure you're able to go still.
Okay.
So I'll just try to give them a call and say, hey, I'm going to sports.
It's on my schedule.
Nope.
You're good.
I'm on there.
You're set.
I appreciate that.
And I'll put a comment on here that says, might go earlier if not working.
But I have you leaving at 430, being home by 630.
Yeah.
That way you're cutting in time still in case you do work.
All right.
That is good for that.
I'm going to go back.
um just so you know i won't be here next monday so we're just gonna do two
weeks and i'll see you
on april 28th make things easier that'd be great i think that helps everyone
else out when i do that
kind of stuff instead of making trying to get you guys in here to see somebody
that doesn't really
work with you guys that much you know i mean yeah i had to do it with
probation when i was in
no more than street and i would see this girl and she's like asking these rolling
depth questions

looked at your case
uh do you need to know health services you're all bro you said i never asked
you that stuff yeah
huh you said i never asked you that my regular probation officer never did oh
okay how life was
going how work was going just like you do yeah and she was like wanting to
know like my mental health
and i'm like girl like who's that it was at adult probation and franklin i don't
know her name but
